## General info
Just return license info in response.
I'm aware that Django is an overkill for such API, but I was learning Django that time.



## Setup
* Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. (I developed it with Python 3.7)
* Some Python modules are required which are contained in requirements.txt and will be installed below.

#### 1. Upload files to your server

#### 2. Requirements
In the license-auth-API folder, run:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Adapt the command to your operating system if needed.


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.7
* Django
